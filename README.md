  - Sign up and log in functionalities.
  - Dashboard where you can see the projects (including filtering function) and the users that are currently online.
  - You can select a task and you will see information about the task and you have a coment section to comunicate with other users.

  - You can create new tasks and asign them to other users.
  - Log out functionality.
